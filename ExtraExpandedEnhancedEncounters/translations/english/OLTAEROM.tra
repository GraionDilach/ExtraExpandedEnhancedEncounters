@400 = ~I've collected some scales of a young fire drake. Can you do anything out from this?~
@401 = ~I've come for that dragon scale armor, I believe you've managed to craft it by now.~
@402 = ~Dragon scales, you say? Let me take a look.~
@403 = ~Dragon scales indeed. And in such a good shape even. While this isn't enough for a full scale armor, I already have an idea how to combine these with one of my leather armors to provide all the protection one would need and expect from this material. While it's been a while I've done this, I'm sure this will work. That would take me six days and 4000 gold though. You see, dealing with dragon scales take a fair amount of effort afterall.~
@404 = ~So, what do you think? Six days and a mere 4000 gold for a dragon scale armor?~
@405 = ~I think you've just struck a deal.~
@406 = ~Let me think about it for a while.~
@407 = ~Wonderful! You've made a great decision and I am sure you will not regret it. Come back when it's ready and tailored just for you!~
@408 = ~Sure, come back when you changed your mind. It isn't often when one offers an opportunity to work on such material.~
@409 = ~Ah yes, the dragon scale armor. One of my best works of recent, I think. It was a pleasure working on it and I am glad of the opportunity. Here you are, I feel you'll be satisfied as well.~
