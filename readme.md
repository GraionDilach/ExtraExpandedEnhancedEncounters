Original author: WithinAmnesia (v1.0)  
Maintainance: Graion Dilach (v2.0+)

## Install order instructions

This mod should be installed after (along with other) questmods but before tweakmods.  
This mod should be installed after Ascalon's Questpack.

## List of components:

### Melia Quicknight, Crossroads

Adds a gnome fighter/cleric assassin awaiting the Bhaalspawn near the Crossroads path just above Beregost.

### Bimmy's Badgering Bandits

Adds Bimmy, the human wizard slayer to Ioin Gallchobhair's group in the Lonely Peaks.

### Reinforced Gnoll Stronghold

This component adds a lot of tougher gnolls to the Stronghold area. It also adds a few jellies/puddings to some of the pits.  
**Note that this component heavily changes the experience and the powerlevel of the Stronghold area. Do not install this component if you like to rush the Stronghold for the tome.**  
*Maintainer's note: This component is considered to be split apart at one point to decrease difficulty in a possible future release.*

### Bear Encounter near the Gnoll Stronghold

Adds a few bears to the cave under the Gnoll Stronghold where the tome is.  
This component requires Siege of Dragonspear/Enhanced Edition Trilogy and will not install on vanilla Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition installs.

### Xan's New Grove

Adds a fair amount of additional items to Mulahey's chest, one dedicated to Xan, and a few other intended for him.  
This component also adds additional effects to his moonblade.

### Daenni's Bridge Bandits

Adds an encounter against Daenni and her guards to the lower bridge of Cloakwook Wyverns.

### The Fire Drake in the Wyvern Cave

Adds a few additional wyverns and a fire drake to the Wyvern Cave.  
Also allows Taerom to craft an additional armor after the encounter.

### Undercity Magma Bulwark Encounter; Red Skeleton-(U.M.B.E.R.S.)

Adds an encounter against a fair amount of skeletons around the Magma Bulwark introduced in the Enhanced Edition.  
Also changes the icon of the Magma Bulwark.

## Version History:

### Version 1.0

Initial release

### Version 2.0

Fixed: Gnolls using nonexistant item OLEAT10 instead of LEAT10 (Hide Armor).  
Fixed: "Conflict" with Ascalon's Questpack - Feast of Gnolls - Fission Slime no longer spawns if Aaron occupies the cell.  

Changed: Each area encounter is now a separate component.  
Note: The Gnoll Stronghold bear cave encounter only uses SoD monsters, so it's skipped on vanilla BGEE.  

Added: Traification.  
Added: EET support.  
Added: Safeguards against classic and incompatible games.  
Added: Project Infinity metadata.  

### Version 3.0

Added: Red Drakescale Armor +2 ("studded leather" armor available via Taerom from the drake encounter)

Fixed: Wyvern Cave encounter actually spawns now (and also doesn't break other mods trying to use the cave and installed prior).  
Fixed: Bimmy waits for Ioin Gallchobhair's action before attacking.  
Fixed: Melia will no longer attempt to heal the player (she will also be affected by SCS's priest script).  
Fixed: BG1NPC Xan will respond appropriately when he receives the New Grove Moonblade.  
Fixed: StrongArm description icon was corrupted.  
Fixed: Many description inconsistencies.

Changed: Moonblade no longer provides additional magical fire resistance, and the leech-life damage is delivered as magic damage. Restored BGEE assumption of using Dagger class.  
Changed: Melia's Ring of Accurate Striking only provides +1 Melee THAC0 (Mulahey's remained untouched).  
Changed: No longer substitute vanilla items but patch them (Xan's Moonblade, Magma Bulwark, Bimmy's helmet).  
Changed: The mod no longer tries to completely rearrange th3e contents of Mulahey's chest.  
Changed: Removed additional type of healing potions and substituted them with BG1 counterparts and Potion of Fortitude.

### Version 3.1

Changed: Expose the Magma Bulwark icon patching to an external ini configuration option, to allow players to have the alternative icon in Tweaks Anthology v13's Unique Icons with the U.M.B.E.R.S. component. Prior to the mod installation; copy the ini/ol_eeee.ini file to override and edit ol_magma_bulwark_icon value to 0 for this option.

### Version 3.2

Fixed: one typo in Bimmy's variable.

### Version 4.0

Adds Russian translation by yota13 & p_zombie.

### Version 4.1

Fixed: wrong random treasures dropped in the Gnoll Stronghold and Undercity section on EET.
